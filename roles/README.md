# Roles

Create roles here, in either the Role Ruby DSL (.rb) or JSON (.json) files.

To install roles on the server, use knife.

# Knife role

The knife role subcommand is used to manage the roles that are associated with one or more nodes on a Chef server.

```
$ knife role from file FILE
$ knife role show ROLE_NAME
$ knife role edit ROLE_NAME
$ knife role delete ROLE_NAME
```
